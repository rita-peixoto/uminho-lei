## Software Labs III

In this project we built an app capable of reading and managing big amounts of data. We learned that there are really good and efficient algorithms and data structures capable of dealing with a great volume of data. 

This project was both coded in [C](https://github.com/rita-peixoto/uminho-lei/tree/main/2YEAR/2nd/LI3/projetoC) and in [Java](https://github.com/rita-peixoto/uminho-lei/tree/main/2YEAR/2nd/LI3/projetoJava).
