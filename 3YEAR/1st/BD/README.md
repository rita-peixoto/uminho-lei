### :sparkles: Bases de Dados

We worked on "Series & Companhia" database, a streaming plaftorm for series. 
This database was built using the relational model and mySQL.

[Here](https://github.com/rita-peixoto/uminho-lei/blob/main/3YEAR/1st/BD/RelatorioBD_G13_Fase_I.pdf) you can find the report of the project and [here](https://github.com/rita-peixoto/uminho-lei/blob/main/3YEAR/1st/BD/queries.sql) is some relevant sql code.
